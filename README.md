# Music-player-react-native

Prerequisite
- Have npm installed

Starting the app

Once you have cloned the app run the following commands:

```
$ npm i 
```


```
$ npm run ios
```

Auto download of Expo:

If you do not have expo installed globally, it will give you a prompt to download it, this is needed to run the app. Choose yes from the options.

Manual download of Expo:
```
$ npm install -g expo-cli
```
This will then run a Metro Bundler on your local host. Once the 'tunnel ready' command is displayed, it will automatically run this app on your default simulator. The phone used to develop this was IPhone 8.
